    <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Our commitment to creating a safe, supportive, and respectful space for everyone.
    </p>

    <div class="guidelines-card">
      <p>
        While SerenePath does not currently have interactive community features, we are
        building with the future in mind. These guidelines will apply to any future forums,
        groups, or sharing features to ensure our community remains a sanctuary for healing
        and growth. By using SerenePath, you agree to uphold these principles in all potential
        future interactions.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Be Kind and Courteous</h3>
      <p>
        We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with
        respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness is required.
      </p>

      <h3>2. No Hate Speech or Bullying</h3>
      <p>
        Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't allowed, and degrading
        comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity
        will not be tolerated.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Respect Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Being part of this community requires mutual trust. Authentic, expressive discussions
        make groups great, but may also be sensitive and private. What’s shared in the group
        should stay in the group.
      </p>

      <h3>4. No Promotions or Spam</h3>
      <p>
        Give more than you take to this group. Self-promotion, spam, and irrelevant links are not
        allowed.
      </p>
       <h3>5. No Promotions or Spam</h3>
            <p>Self-promotion, spam and irrelevant links aren't allowed. This space is for support, not for
                marketing or selling goods and services.</p>

        <p class="below"> We reserve the right to remove content and users that violate these guidelines. Thank you for
            helping us build a compassionate and trustworthy community.</p>
