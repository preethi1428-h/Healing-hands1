      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to provide an accessible, supportive, and non-judgmental tool that empowers individuals 
        to take control of their recovery journey. We believe that technology, when thoughtfully applied, 
        can be a powerful ally in building healthier habits, fostering self-awareness, and providing consistent 
        encouragement. Healing Hands is designed to be a private, personal companion that helps you structure your 
        day with positive, recovery-focused activities.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a world where everyone has access to the support they need to overcome life's challenges. 
        Our goal is for Healing Hands to be more than just a tool; we aim to build a platform that reduces the 
        stigma associated with addiction and mental health, promotes open conversation, and connects individuals 
        with resources that can make a real difference. We are committed to continuous improvement, guided by 
        user feedback and the latest research in behavioral health.
